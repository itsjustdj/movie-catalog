# movie-catalog

This project is a simple catalog I created for my family to track our movie and book collections. It's just HTML, CSS and PHP. At some point, I may add JavaScript to add some functionality and also create the ability to toggle which movies have been seen or updated by user.

I created this personal project so I could learn PHP. I realize there are a lot of things that coule be done differently or better, like using PDO instead of msql. It's not exactly a _super secure_ use of login code. I may update this or start a new project that uses better security.
