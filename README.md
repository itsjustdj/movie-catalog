# movie-catalog

This project is a simple catalog I created for my family to track our movie and book collections. It's just HTML, CSS and PHP. At some point, I may add JavaScript to add some functionality and also create the ability to toggle which movies have been seen or updated by user.

I created this personal project so I could learn PHP. I realize there are a lot of things that coule be done differently or better, like using PDO instead of msql. It's not exactly a _super secure_ use of login code. I may update this or start a new project that uses better security.

The movies.sql and users.sql files are there to import into your own db if you want to try the site with data without having to build it yourself.

If you have any questions, suggestions or just want to give me feedback on my code (please?), you can contact me at dj@itsjustdj.com.
